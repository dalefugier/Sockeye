Sockeye
=======

Sockeye is a prototype of how one my attempt to integrate Rhino with Revit.

The solution consists of three projects:

1.) Sockeye       - A Rhino 5.0 plug-in based on RhinoCommon.
2.) SockeyeServer - A Revit Archictecture 2012 plug-in.
3.) SockeyeCommon - Some source code shared between the above projects.

The two plug-ins communicate via WCF, or Windows Communication Foundation.
